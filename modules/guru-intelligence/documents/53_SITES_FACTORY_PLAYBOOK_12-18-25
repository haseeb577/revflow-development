SECTION 1: THE PHILOSOPHY (READ THIS FIRST)
1.1 Why This Manual Exists
You are about to produce content for 53 rank-and-rent websites. This is not a simple "click a button and let AI write" job. If we do that, we create "AI Slop" that Google de-indexes in weeks1.
The Critical Insight:
The Automation (Python App) tells the AI WHAT to write and HOW to format it2.
YOU (The Human Researcher) must tell the AI WHAT SPECIFICALLY to say3.
Think of it this way:
The Python Script is the blueprint that says "build a 2,000 sq ft house with 3 bedrooms"4.
YOU are the architect who researches the lot, understands the family's needs, selects the materials, and designs something that actually works for that specific location5.
1.2 The "60/40" Rule
Automation = 40% of the solution. It handles structure, formatting, markdown, and drafting6.
Your Enhancement = 60% of the solution. It handles research, local intelligence, differentiation, and QA7.
1.3 The Six Value-Add Layers
Staff is responsible for injecting these specific data points into the Master CSV8.
Layer
What the Python Script Does
What YOU Must Research (CSV Input)
1. Local Context
Places {{ location }} placeholders.
Actual Neighborhoods: "Watters Creek, Twin Creeks."

Climate: "Black clay soil," "95°F Heat."
2. Industry Knowledge
Writes generic service descriptions.
Jargon: "P-trap," "Slab leak," "Backflow prevention."
3. Credible Backstory
Generates a generic "About Us."
Demographics: San Antonio = 64% Hispanic $\rightarrow$ Founder "Martinez."
4. Market Intel
Generates generic FAQs.
PAA Questions: Real questions scraped from Google.
5. Differentiation
Uses a standard sentence structure.
Voice Selection: Rotate between "Partner," "Professor," "Peer."
6. Quality Control
Hits word counts.
Blacklist Check: Remove "In today's fast-paced world."

1.4 The Three Gaps We Must Solve
The Python App cannot solve these gaps alone. Your research in the CSV is the only bridge9.
Gap Type
What's Missing in AI
The Impact
Your Job (The Fix)
Substance Gap
Prompts tell format, not content.
Output is generic fluff.
Inject specific research (neighborhoods, soil types).
Intelligence Gap
No real-time market data.
Content isn't competitive.
Add PAA questions from actual Google searches.
Differentiation Gap
Same prompts = similar output.
53 sites look identical.
Vary the "Founder Persona" and tone per site.


SECTION 2: THE TECH STACK & INFRASTRUCTURE
2.1 Central Command Stack
Command Center: MainWP (Manage updates/security/plugins for 53 sites from one screen)10.
Hosting: Hostinger Cloud/VPS (Min 4GB RAM). Do not use Shared Hosting as it will crash during batch imports.
DNS: Cloudflare Free Tier (Essential for IP masking and security)11.
CMS: WordPress + Elementor Pro (Required for Global Widgets)12.
SEO: RankMath Free (Automates Schema and Sitemaps)13.
Data Engine: WP All Import Pro (The factory belt for injecting content)14.
Call Tracking: Twilio (API integration for tracking calls).
2.2 File Organization
Create this exact folder structure on your computer to keep the "Factory" organized 15:
Plaintext
53-Site-Content-Production/
├── Site-Data/
│   ├── sites.csv (The Master CSV for Python)
│   └── Site-Research-Notes/

SECTION 3: THE DEEP RESEARCH PROTOCOL (THE "HUMAN LAYER")
CRITICAL: Do this BEFORE running the Python App. This is where you earn your paycheck16.
3.1 Step 1: Site Variable Gathering (5 Minutes)
Open the Master CSV (sites.csv) and locate the row for the site you are working on. You must define 17:
Company Name: (e.g., Allen Bee Hive Rescue)
Industry/Category: (e.g., Bee Rescue)
Primary Location: (e.g., Allen, Texas)
Service List: (Comma separated list of 5-7 core services)
3.2 Step 2: Local Context Research (15 Minutes)
Goal: Prove to Google that we are locals. Generic "City" info is not enough18.
Major Neighborhoods: Find 3-5 specific subdivisions19.
Where to look: Google Maps (zoom in), Zillow (filter by neighborhood), Wikipedia.
Example: "Watters Creek, Twin Creeks, Star Creek"20.
Local Landmarks: What is recognizable to a local?21.
Example: "Eagle Stadium, Allen Premium Outlets"22.
Climate/Geography: What physical conditions affect this service?23.
Example: "Texas heat (95°F+) = active bee season April-October"24.
Example: "Black clay soil causes foundation shifts in Allen."
Example: "Coastal humidity requires rust-proof HVAC parts"25.
3.3 Step 3: Industry Knowledge Research (15 Minutes)
Goal: Inject technical credibility so we don't sound like a generic AI26.
Jargon & Terms: Find 5-10 terms professionals use27.
Example: "P-trap," "Hydro-jetting," "Swarm capture," "Queen relocation."
Equipment: What specific tools do they use?28.
Example: "Thermal Imaging Cameras," "Augers," "Bee Vacuums."
Common Problems: What specific pain points do customers have?29.
Example: "Bees inside brick walls," "Slab leaks," "Roots in sewer line."
Source: Search Reddit (r/plumbing, r/beekeeping) or YouTube videos from pros30.
3.4 Step 4: Credible Backstory & Demographics (10 Minutes)
Goal: Create believable founders/teams that match the local population31.
Search: Google [City] demographics32.
Analyze: Look at the ethnic/cultural breakdown33.
Create Persona:
Scenario A: San Antonio (64% Hispanic) $\rightarrow$ Founder: "Carlos Martinez".
Scenario B: Allen, TX (20% Asian) $\rightarrow$ Founder: "Marcus Chen"34.
Scenario C: Plano, TX (Corporate/Suburban) $\rightarrow$ Founder: "James Mitchell".
3.5 Step 5: Market Intelligence (20 Minutes)
Goal: Capture real search intent using "People Also Ask" 35.
Google Search: [Service] in [Location].
Locate PAA: Look for the "People Also Ask" box.
Record: Copy 5-10 actual questions into the CSV paa_questions column.
"How much does bee removal cost in Allen?"
"Is bee removal covered by homeowners insurance?"
"Do you kill the bees or relocate them?"
3.6 Step 6: Proprietary Mechanism Naming
Invent a unique name for the standard service process to own the "Knowledge Graph" entity.
Plumbing: Hydro-Force™ Flow Audit
Roofing: Weather-Guard™ Structural Analysis
Bee Removal: Eco-Safe™ Colony Relocation Protocol
HVAC: Efficiency-Max™ Performance Calibration

SECTION 4: THE AUTOMATION ARCHITECTURE (PYTHON APP)
4.1 How the "Stacked Prompt" Works
The Python script doesn't just send one instruction. It constructs a 3-Layer Prompt 36:
Layer 1 (System): Sets the "Voice" (Partner/Professor/Peer) and enforces Markdown formatting.
Layer 2 (Context): Injects your CSV research (Neighborhoods, Mechanism, Backstory).
Layer 3 (Task): Specifies the page type (Homepage vs. Service Page) and structure.
4.2 Executing the Script
Save CSV: Ensure your sites.csv is saved in the Site-Data folder.
Run: Open your terminal and run python factory_gen.py.
Monitor: Watch for success messages: Generating Site-01... Saved homepage.md.
Output: Check the Generated-Content folder. You should see ~30 Markdown files per site.
4.3 The "Rank Expand" Syntax Reference
The Python App outputs specific shortcodes. Staff must NOT delete these during QA.
Syntax
What It Renders
Correct Usage
(call: )
Click-to-call button (No number).
In Leader Block Line 337.
(cta: call)
"Call Now" Button.
Throughout body text38.
(cta: estimate)
"Free Estimate" Button.
Throughout body text39.
(offer: contact-now)
Contact Form.
At the bottom of the page40.
{{ phone }}
Twilio Tracking Number.
In text (e.g., "Call us at {{ phone }}")41.
{{ location }}
Neighborhood Name.
In location pages42.


SECTION 5: QUALITY ASSURANCE (THE "TRUTH ECONOMY" STANDARDS)
Strict "Pass/Fail" standards. Staff must verify these items before publishing.
5.1 The "AI Phrase Blacklist"
Scan content for these phrases. If found, REWRITE immediately 43434343.
❌ "In today's fast-paced world"
❌ "It's important to note that"
❌ "When it comes to [X]"
❌ "The fact of the matter is"
❌ "At the end of the day"
❌ "Dive deep into"
❌ "Cutting-edge"
❌ "Seamless" / "Game-changer" / "Revolutionize"
❌ "Unlock the power of..."
5.2 Word Count & Structure Verification
Verify these specs using a word counter 44:
Page Element
Target Length
Notes
Homepage
1,200 – 2,000 words
The Executive Summary of the business45.
Service Page
800 – 1,200 words
Deep dive into one specific topic46.
Location Page
~800 words
Hyper-local focus on one neighborhood47.
Intro
$\le$ 200 words
Must immediately address search intent48.
Service Intro
$\le$ 20 words
Strictly one sentence49.
Leader Block
Exactly 3 Lines
Line 1: H3 / Line 2: H1 / Line 3: (call: )50.
Tagline
50-65 characters
Punchy and memorable51.

5.3 The 3-Point "Truth Check"
Mechanism Check: Is the proprietary name (e.g., Hydro-Force) present?
Geo Check: Is the specific neighborhood (e.g., Watters Creek) present in the body text?52.
BLUF Check: Does the first sentence under H2 headers answer the question directly? (e.g., "Cost is $150," not "Cost depends on factors").
5.4 Content Quality Checklist
Uniqueness: Compare pages within the same site (Homepage vs Service). Do they sound different?53.
Repetition: Check for "we pride ourselves" or "your trusted partner" appearing too often54.
Placeholders: Ensure {{ location }} is not appearing as text in the final output55.
Links: Content should be plain markdown. NO hyperlinks should be present in the raw text56.

SECTION 6: PUBLISHING & INJECTION (WP ALL IMPORT)
6.1 CSV Preparation (From Python to WordPress)
Your Python script generates Markdown. You must convert/export this to a CSV for WP All Import with these columns57:
page_title
page_slug (Unique Identifier)
body_html (The content)
leader_html (The 3-line hero block)
focus_keyword
meta_description
6.2 WP All Import Configuration
New Import: Upload CSV. Select "Pages" 58.
Mapping:
Drag page_title $\rightarrow$ Title.
Drag body_html $\rightarrow$ Content.
Elementor: Map leader_html $\rightarrow$ Elementor Hero Widget Custom Field59.
RankMath: Map meta_description $\rightarrow$ rank_math_description60.
Unique Identifier: Set page_slug as the unique key61.
Save Template: Save settings for reuse62.
6.3 Common Import Troubleshooting 63
Issue
Cause
Fix
Content shows as Markdown
HTML not processed.
Enable "Process HTML" in import settings.
CTAs show as text (cta: call)
Shortcodes not rendering.
Ensure Shortcode Plugin is active.
Elementor Template Missing
Wrong template name.
Check template names match exactly.
Meta Description blank
Field mapping error.
Verify map to rank_math_description.
Duplicate pages created
No Unique ID.
Set page_slug as the Unique Key.

6.4 Manual Publishing (Fallback Method)
Use this for the first 5 pages to learn the structure64.
Log into WordPress65.
New Page: Set Title and Permalink 66.
Template: Select Elementor template (e.g., template-service)67.
Paste: Leader block into Hero widget; Body into Main Content widget 68.
Replace: Manually swap {{ phone }} with Twilio number69.
SEO: Set Focus Keyword and Meta Description in RankMath 70.
Publish71.

SECTION 7: 90-DAY STRATEGIC EXECUTION
7.1 The Strategy: "Hyper-Local for All"
Whether the site has a verified Google Business Profile (GBP) or not ("Ghost"), we use the same content strategy:
The "Moat": While competitors fight for "City" keywords, we build hundreds of pages for specific Neighborhoods.
The Benefit: Ranking for "Plumber Watters Creek" is easier than "Plumber Allen," and the conversion rate is higher.
7.2 Barnacle SEO (Weeks 9-12)
Since Ghost sites cannot rank in the Map Pack, we rank via proxy 72:
Create Yelp profiles for the business.
Create Angi profiles.
Create Nextdoor business pages.
Goal: When a user searches "Best Plumber [Neighborhood]," they see your Yelp profile (which has your Twilio number).
7.3 Monetization (Month 4+)
Trigger: Site generates 5 verified calls/month.
Action: Find local pros on Page 2 of Google Maps.
Pitch: "I have a site in [Neighborhood] generating calls. Flat $500/mo. Want them?"

SECTION 8: TROUBLESHOOTING & KNOWLEDGE BASE 73
Problem: "The content sounds too generic/AI-written."
Solution: You skipped the Research Phase. You didn't inject enough local/industry context. Go back to the CSV and add specific landmarks and technical terms 74.
Problem: "Content is too short (below minimum word count)."
Solution: Check the Python config. Increase the Word Count parameter in the PAGE_PROMPTS dictionary. Also, ensure you added enough PAA questions in the CSV 75.
Problem: "Content is too long (above maximum)."
Solution: Ask the AI to "tighten content by removing redundancy" 76.
Problem: "Placeholders like {{ phone }} aren't being replaced."
Solution: Check your CSV/Script logic. Manual fix: Use Find/Replace in WordPress editor 77.
Problem: "Pages from different sites sound too similar."
Solution: Differentiation Gap! Check the voice_type in your CSV. Are you rotating between "Partner," "Peer," and "Professor"? Change the Founder Persona 78.
Problem: "Generated content doesn't match Rank Expand examples."
Solution: Check that {{ site.promptKnowledge }} (Golden Examples) is correctly loading in the Python script context 79.

SECTION 8: TROUBLESHOOTING & KNOWLEDGE BASE
Common problems staff will encounter and exactly how to fix them 2.
8.1 Content Quality Issues
Problem
Diagnosis
Solution
"Content sounds too generic"
Substance Gap. You skipped the Research Phase and didn't inject enough local/industry context.
1. Return to CSV.

2. Add specific landmarks (e.g., "Eagle Stadium").

3. Add technical terms (e.g., "P-trap").

4. Re-run script.
"Content is too short"
Prompting Issue. The AI ran out of tokens or ideas.
1. Increase Word Count param in Python script.

2. Add more PAA questions to the CSV.

3. Expand "Why Choose Us" with specific examples.
"Content is too long/fluffy"
Conciseness Issue.
1. Edit prompt to say: "Tighten content by removing redundancy."

2. Remove repetitive "In conclusion" sections.

3. Condense lists.
"Sites sound too similar"
Differentiation Gap. The "Voice" isn't rotating.
1. Check voice_type in CSV. Rotate between Partner/Peer/Professor.

2. Change the "Founder Persona" backstory completely.

3. Vary the mechanism_name.

8.2 Technical & Formatting Issues
Problem
Diagnosis
Solution
"Placeholders ({{ phone }}) visible"
Injection Failure. The script or WP All Import didn't swap the variable.
1. check CSV data.

2. Manual Fix: Use "Better Search Replace" plugin in WordPress to swap {{ phone }} with the actual number site-wide.
"CTAs showing as text"
Shortcode Failure. (cta: call) appears as plain text.
1. Ensure the Shortcode Plugin is active.

2. Check for typos in syntax (e.g., (CTA: Call) vs (cta: call)).
"500 Server Error on Import"
Hosting Overload. Hostinger VPS is maxing out RAM.
1. Reduce WP All Import batch size to 1 file/iteration.

2. Upgrade VPS RAM to 4GB+.

3. Disable non-essential plugins during import.
"Rank Expand Style not matching"
Context Failure. The AI isn't seeing the "Golden Examples."
1. Check that {{ site.promptKnowledge }} is correctly loading the example text in the Python script.

8.3 When to Ask for Help
Contact the Project Lead immediately if 3:
[ ] You have spent 2+ hours researching a single site and still lack context.
[ ] The AI consistently generates content with hallucinated facts (e.g., inventing laws).
[ ] WP All Import fails repeatedly with critical errors.
[ ] You discover systematic data errors in the Google Sheet (e.g., wrong cities for zip codes).

SECTION 11: FINAL TRAINING NOTES (THE "BRIDGE PROCESS")
11.1 This is a Bridge 4
Remember: This manual workflow exists until the R&R Automation app is fully autonomous.
Everything you are doing manually (Research, QA) teaches the system how to eventually do it automatically.
✅ Research $\rightarrow$ Will eventually be done by DataForSEO API + RAG.
✅ QA Checks $\rightarrow$ Will eventually be run by /api/qa/check.
11.2 What You Are Learning 5
By doing this manually, you are learning:
How to research effectively: Context is what makes content rank.
Quality Standards: What "good content" actually looks like to a human.
The Full Workflow: How a row in a spreadsheet becomes a live, money-making website.
11.3 Feedback Loop 6
As you work, document:
Steps that are unclear.
Research that takes too long.
Quality issues you encounter repeatedly.
Report these to the Project Lead to improve Version 10.0.

🔍 KEY QUESTIONS FOR YOU:
SERVICE PAGES - How should we get 10 services per business?


Option A: You manually expand CSV?
Option B: AI generates from category standards?
Option C: We discover from competitors?
LOCATION PAGES - LocationDiscovery working?


Already built, just needs real data source
SUPPORTING PAGES - Are these 4 the right ones?


FAQ, Reviews, Blog, Estimate
Or different pages?
TEAM/CAREERS - Real data or generate?


Generic content for all?
Skip these pages?
What's your take? 🤔

EXCELLENT strategic questions! You're absolutely right - we need world-class, not approximations.
Let me address each systematically:

🎯 1. REAL DATA SOURCE FOR LOCATIONS
Using DataForSEO Location Database (Already Have Access!)
# First, let's see what DataForSEO offers for location data
cat > /tmp/test_dataforseo_locations.py << 'EOF'
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os
import requests
import base64
import json

login = "shimon.abouzaglo@vsrcouncil.org"
password = "0dde0c3934e10d5e"

credentials = base64.b64encode(f"{login}:{password}".encode()).decode()
headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Basic {credentials}',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

# Get location data
url = "https://api.dataforseo.com/v3/serp/google/locations"
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
data = response.json()

print("DataForSEO Locations API:")
print(json.dumps(data['tasks'][0]['result'][:5], indent=2))
EOF

python3 /tmp/test_dataforseo_locations.py
Run that - DataForSEO has a comprehensive location database we can use!

🏆 2. COMPETITOR ANALYSIS - THE MISSING LAYER
You're 100% right - we need competitor research. Here's the framework:
Competitor Tiers:
Tier 1: National Brands (Aspirational positioning)
Purpose: "What does world-class look like?"
Examples: HomeAdvisor, Angi, Thumbtack
Analysis: Messaging, service breadth, trust signals
Tier 2: Regional Leaders (Direct competition)
Purpose: "Who dominates our metro?"
Examples: Top 3-5 companies in Dallas/Houston for category
Analysis: Pricing, service areas, customer reviews
Tier 3: Local SMBs (Immediate competitors)
Purpose: "Who's fighting for same customers?"
Examples: Companies in same city with <50 employees
Analysis: Rankings, reviews, local presence
Tier 4: Adjacent Services (Expansion opportunities)
Purpose: "Who can we cross-sell to?"
Examples: Roofers → Gutter cleaning, Electricians → HVAC

DataForSEO Competitor Discovery:
# Use DataForSEO to find actual competitors
def discover_competitors(business_name, category, location):
    """
    Find real competitors using DataForSEO SERP data
    
    Returns:
    - National brands (top 10 organic results)
    - Regional players (local pack results)
    - Local SMBs (nearby businesses)
    """
    
    # Query: "[category] near [location]"
    # Extract:
    # 1. Organic results (national/regional)
    # 2. Local pack (local SMBs)
    # 3. Related searches (adjacent services)

💡 3. DIFFERENTIATION FRAMEWORK
Use Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) Framework:
Customer Jobs:
Functional: "Fix my broken AC before it gets hot"
Emotional: "Don't want to be ripped off by contractor"
Social: "Want reliable company neighbors trust"
Differentiation Vectors:
Speed: Emergency 24/7 vs next-day vs scheduled
Trust: Licensed/insured, reviews, guarantees
Price: Premium vs mid-market vs budget
Expertise: Specialists vs generalists
Convenience: Online booking, transparent pricing
Competitive Positioning Matrix:
         High Trust
            |
    SMB     |    National Brand
  Regional  |    (Angi, HomeAdvisor)
            |
Low Price---+---High Price
            |
  Discount  |    Premium
  Services  |    Specialists
            |
        Low Trust

📋 4. SERVICE DETERMINATION - AUTOMATED
Current Problem: CSV has generic "roof repair, roof replacement, inspections"
Solution: Use DataForSEO + AI to discover actual services:
def discover_services(business_name, category, location):
    """
    Discover actual services offered by analyzing:
    1. DataForSEO: Related searches for business
    2. Competitor websites: What services do competitors offer?
    3. AI extraction: Parse business website for services
    
    Returns comprehensive service list
    """

✅ YOUR DECISION:
Do you want me to:
Build Phase 1 RIGHT NOW - Real location discovery with DataForSEO?
Design full competitive intelligence architecture - Then build all 3 phases?
Start with competitor research first - This might be more valuable?
Which approach? I'm ready to build world-class! 💪

EXCELLENT QUESTION! Let me lay out the logic BEFORE coding:

🎯 Location Discovery Logic & Strategy
GOAL: Find 8-10 high-value service area pages per site

TIER 1: Primary Location (Always Include - 1 page)
Input: "Allen, Texas"
Output: "Allen" as main service area
Logic: This is where the business is based

TIER 2: Affluent Nearby Cities (3-5 pages)
Data Source: US Census API
1. Geocode main city → get lat/long
2. Find all cities within 15-mile radius
3. Filter by:
   - Population > 25,000 (enough demand)
   - Median household income > $75,000 (can afford services)
4. Sort by income (highest first)
5. Take top 3-5 cities
Example for Allen, TX:
✅ Plano (income: $95k, 10 miles)
✅ Frisco (income: $110k, 8 miles)
✅ McKinney (income: $88k, 12 miles)
❌ Garland (income: $58k) - too low

TIER 3: Commercial Landmarks & Shopping Centers (2-3 pages)
Data Sources: Google Places API + OpenStreetMap
1. Search within 15-mile radius for:
   - "shopping mall"
   - "shopping center" 
   - "business district"
   - Known landmarks
2. Filter by:
   - Google rating > 4.0
   - Total reviews > 500 (high traffic)
3. Take top 2-3 by prominence
Example for Allen, TX:
✅ Stonebriar Centre (major mall, Frisco)
✅ Legacy West (business district, Plano)
✅ The Shops at Willow Bend

TIER 4: Search Volume Validation (Re-rank all)
Data Sources: Pytrends + DataForSEO
1. For each discovered location, check:
   - Pytrends: "[service] in [location]" search volume
   - DataForSEO: Keyword difficulty + monthly searches
2. Score each location:
   - Income: 40%
   - Search volume: 30%
   - Distance: 20% (closer = better)
   - Population: 10%
3. Re-rank and take top 8-10

TIER 5: Known Intersections (1-2 pages if space)
Data Source: Pytrends
1. Check common intersections/areas:
   - "[highway] and [road]"
   - "Near [landmark]"
2. Only include if search volume > 100/month
Example for Dallas:
"75 and Parker Road"
"Preston and Forest"
"Galleria area"

📊 SCORING FORMULA
location_score = (
    income_percentile * 0.40 +      # Affluence (40%)
    search_volume_percentile * 0.30 + # Demand (30%)
    proximity_score * 0.20 +          # Distance (20%)
    population_percentile * 0.10      # Market size (10%)
)

🚨 FALLBACK LOGIC
If < 8 locations found:
Expand radius to 25 miles
Lower income threshold to $65k
Include adjacent suburbs
Use metro-specific manual overrides
Metro-Specific Overrides (JSON file):
{
  "Dallas, TX": ["Highland Park", "University Park", "Preston Hollow"],
  "Houston, TX": ["River Oaks", "Memorial", "The Woodlands"],
  "Los Angeles, CA": ["Beverly Hills", "Santa Monica", "Pasadena"]
}

✅ FINAL OUTPUT (8-10 locations)
For Allen Bee Hive Rescue Services in Allen, TX:
Allen (primary)
Plano (affluent city, 10 mi)
Frisco (affluent city, 8 mi)
McKinney (affluent city, 12 mi)
Richardson (affluent city, 15 mi)
Stonebriar Centre (landmark)
Legacy West (business district)
Dallas - North Dallas (major metro)

Does this logic make sense? Any changes you'd suggest? 🤔
