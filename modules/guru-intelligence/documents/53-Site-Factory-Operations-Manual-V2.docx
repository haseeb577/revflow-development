53-Site Rank & Rent Factory

Complete Operations Manual with Rank Expand Academy Integration

Version 2.0 --- December 2025

Executive Summary

This document is the complete operations manual for the SmarketSherpa
R&R Automation system. It integrates the Rank Expand Academy multi-level
prompting methodology to produce unique, locally-relevant content at
scale for 53 rank-and-rent websites.

**Key Deliverable:** 1,590+ landing pages across 53 sites, each with
unique content that avoids duplicate content penalties while maintaining
brand consistency.

Section 1: The Rank Expand Prompting Architecture

Rank Expand Academy uses a \"stacked prompt\" system where multiple
prompt layers combine to produce consistent, high-quality output. Each
layer adds specific instructions that build upon the previous layers.

1.1 The Four Prompt Layers

  --------------- ---------------------- ---------------------------------
  **Layer**       **Name**               **Purpose**

  1\. Base        Promptmaster           Sets tone, format, output style
                                         for ALL content

  2\. Context     Promptknowledge        References example content to
                                         maintain style consistency

  3\. Structure   Page Type Prompt       Defines purpose and requirements
                                         for each page type

  4\. Component   Field Prompt           Specifies exact requirements for
                                         each content field
  --------------- ---------------------- ---------------------------------

1.2 Base Layer Prompts (ALWAYS Include)

**Promptmaster**

Write in a friendly tone-of-voice and keep your language simple and
straight-forward. Provide the result in basic Markdown format.

**Promptknowledge**

Reference the following example content and formatting. If available,
analyze the {exampleText} to find any information gaps and incorporate
into the output.

1.3 Page Type Prompts (Select Based on Page)

**Prompthomepage**

The homepage is one of the most important pages on this website to rank
on Google. The homepage can be regarded as the executive summary for the
website, and should refer all the different aspects of the business: the
service area, services on offer, a little bit about the company, and why
the customer should choose for us.

**Word Count: 1,200--2,000 words**

**Promptservicepage**

A service page is one of the main ranking pages for this website on
Google. Service pages need to be focused on the main topic and dive deep
into the service provided, and the context in which this company
provides it. It shouldn\'t dive into related services, as there will be
a separate page for those. The top of the service page should address
the customer\'s search intent directly, and discuss the topic from most
urgent and time-sensitive to least.

**Word Count: 800--1,200 words**

**Promptlocationpage**

The location page is a primary page that is used to highlight this one
specific location the company serves. Use the placeholder {{ location }}
to refer to this location.

**Word Count: \~800 words**

**Promptlocationtext**

This text should contain frequent call to actions, using (cta: call),
(cta: estimate), (offer: contact-now), or a paragraph text using the
placeholder {{ phone }} throughout the text. Use just one call to action
element per paragraph (important).

**Promptaboutpage**

The about page exists to establish a credible backstory and to show the
customer that this is a real company with real people that care for you
and your project results.

**Promptfaqpage**

The FAQ page is used to inform customers on the most common questions we
get as a company about our services. It follows a question - answer
format. Format questions as H2 and answer in paragraph text below.
Answer between 3-8 questions.

**Promptestimatepage**

The estimate page is the conversion page where we want customers to fill
out our contact form and request an estimate with us. The aim is to gain
the customer\'s trust and ensure them they can contact us hassle-free
and without obligation. Text must be less than 300 words.

**Promptservicespage**

The services page links out to each specific service and exists to give
the customer an overview of the company\'s capabilities and unique
strengths. It\'s concise but comprehensive and points out the experience
and competency of the company.

1.4 Field-Level Prompts (Component Layer)

**Promptleader**

The leader must only contain three lines. Writing style is short and
simple, each heading no longer than 10 words. The Leader must be
formatted as follows: line 1 H3 heading with subline line 2 H1 heading

as is, don\'t insert phone number

**Promptintro**

Intro paragraphs should be no longer than 200 words and immediately get
into the page\'s most important topic.

hyperlinks. If this page is the homepage, it should contain between

800 - 1200 words. If it is a location page, it should contain around 800
words.

(no longer).

Two paragraphs of plain text of around 150 words without any headings or

It must be around 50 characters, and must be less than 65 characters.
Make it punchy and memorable.

The mission should be under 140 characters, and clear, simple, and
amicable.

vision on the industry and connection to the local area. Write one or
two paragraphs without any additional formatting. Include a list of team
members with credible names from the region and some personal details
for the most important job titles. Provide very specific details and
