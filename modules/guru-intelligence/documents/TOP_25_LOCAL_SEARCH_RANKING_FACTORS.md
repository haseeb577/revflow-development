What it is:
The primary category is the strongest signal
you can send to Google about what your
business is.
When someone searches for a specific
business type, Google tries to return the
businesses that are the best match for
what the person is searching for.
How to optimize for it:
Select a primary category that most closely
matches the term you want your business
show up for. Example: â€œPersonal Injury
Attorneyâ€, not â€œLaw Firmâ€
1. Primary Category
What it is:
Proximity in local SEO refers to the distance
between the searcher and your business. The
smaller that distance is, the more likely it is
that youâ€™ll rank.
For example, if Iâ€™m looking for a plumber,
Google will be more inclined to show me the
one down the street, rather than the one on
the other side of the city.
How to optimize for it:
Proximity is a hard factor to opmitize for, but
if you are starting a new business or
relocating, aim for an address in a densely
populated area in order to show up for
more searchers.
2. Proximity of Address
to Point of Search
What it is:
Your business name is very important
because of what we call â€œbranded searchâ€:
Google canâ€™t know if youâ€™re searching for a
keyword or a specific business.
If there is a specific company whose name
matches what you searched, then Google
tends to return it in case you are looking for
that specific business:
3. Keywords in GBP
Business Title (pt. 1)
How to optimize for it:
Officially, stuffing keywords in your
business name is against Googleâ€™s
guidelines.
However, there is a way to do it
risk-free:
1. Change your business name
officially in:
Government sources (DBA)
Your logo
Your website
Your signage
2. Update your citations across the
web.
3. Update your business name on
Google last.
3. Keywords in GBP
Business Title (pt. 2)
What it is:
Itâ€™s important to remember that local search
is map-based, and businesses need to be
located near the searchers to show up
in the local results.
This is why itâ€™s crucial for your business to
fall within the bounds of the city youâ€™re
targeting:
How to optimize for it:
If possible, make sure your address is within
the red dotted line of your city on the map.
4. Physical Address in
City of Search
What it is:
Googleâ€™s algorithm displays businesses that
are open at the time of search higher than
those that are closed.
How to optimize for it:
It may not make sense to set your hours to
24 hours, but you could extend your hours.
If most of your competition closes at 5pm,
and you're open until 7pm, you can capture
more leads during those 2 hours.
5. Business Is Open at
Time of Search
What it is:
When ranking businesses in local search
results, Google takes star ratings into
consideration. The higher your rating, the
more likely it is that youâ€™ll rank well.
How to optimize for it:
Ask happy customers to leave you a review.
However, do not incentivize customers.
Google prohibits giving discounts, rewards,
and monetary compensation in return for
customer reviews.
6. High Numerical
Google Ratings
What it is:
Many local SEOs have noticed that hiding the
address on your Profile (as in the case of
service area businesses) negatively
impacts rankings.
How to optimize for it:
If you run a service area business, consider
opening a staffed physical location in your
city that customers can visit. This way, you
will be able to display your address on
Google and avoid any potential
ranking losses.
7. Address is Showing
on GBP
What it is:
Adding an additional category is like telling
Google: "Please show my Profile for this
search term, too".
How to optimize for it:
Add as many relevant additional categories
(up to 9) to your Profile as you can, but make
sure they actually reflect what your business
does.
Check for new categories every 6 months,
since Google updates them frequently.
8. Additional GBP
Categories
What it is:
If you have to choose between two
businesses with the same overall rating, but
one of them has 13 reviews and the other one
has 246, you are likely to choose the latter.
This is why Google tends to rank businesses
that not only have better reviews, but that
also have more reviews.
How to optimize for it:
Ask every single customer for a review. Even
if you get a bad review here and there, the
good feedback will outweigh the bad.
And remember: The more detailed the review,
the more it will benefit your rankings and
conversions. So, write your review requests
in a way that encourages details.
9. Quantity of Native
Google Reviews
What it is:
Google Maps has two functions: to help you
find the right business and to take you to it.
The second function is the reason Google
places a lot of importance on proximity
and map pin location.
If someone suggests an edit and moves your
pin to the middle of a lake, you will stop
showing up for searchers in your city.
How to optimize for it:
Periodically check that your pin is correctly
placed on the map. If you are in a business
category vulnerable to scams, consider
using a tool like Local Platform to get
notified if your pin is moved.
10. Proper Placement
of the Map Pin
What it is:
Over the past year, local SEOs have noticed
that when their clients get a fresh review,
their Profiles get a boost in their rankings.
How to optimize for it:
Sorry to keep repeating ourselves here... But
ask every customer for a review â€“ and
remind people to write their reviews
when they forget.
If you have a consistent influx of reviews,
and you apply all the other advice in this
guide, you are very likely to outrank
your competitors.
At the very least, aim to get new reviews
more often than your main competitors.
11. Recency of Reviews
What it is:
This factor mostly comes into play when
searches are made from outside of
the city (e.g. if youâ€™re searching for a
Chicago plumber, but youâ€™re located
in LA), or searches that mention
the city name.
How to optimize for it:
There isnâ€™t much you can do for this factor
other than getting a location that is close
to the city center.
12. Proximity of
address to centroid
What it is:
Googleâ€™s algorithm pays a lot of attention to
engagement signals. They gauge which
businesses are interesting to searchers by
tracking user behavior.
If searchers are clicking on a particular GBP
(and then not going back to the list), it must
be a good business!
How to optimize for it:
Make your Profile as compelling as possible
at first sight. That means:
Having a high rating (4.6-5 stars) and a
high number of reviews.
Having converting images, or even better
â€“ videos (which auto-play in Maps).
Filling out your business hours.
Having keyword-rich reviews that trigger
eye-catching justifications in search.
Adding services to get â€œProvides:â€
justifications in search.
13. CTR from
Pack/Maps Results
What it is:
Similar to the review recency factor, this
factor means that Google places a lot of
importance on customer feedback
coming in consistently.
It makes sense: If a Profile gets a couple new
reviews per week, over the course of several
years, that means that the business is alive
and well, and customers are happy with it.
Hence, they want to rank that business.
How to optimize for it:
Do we even have to say it at this point? Ask
every customer for a review.
Also, ask people in a timely manner. Donâ€™t
blast your whole email list with review
requests once every quarter â€“ thatâ€™s not
effective and doesnâ€™t help your rankings.
Instead, ask each customer after their visit.
14. Sustained influx of
reviews over time
What it is:
The name, address and phone number (NAP)
on your website must match those on your
Google Business Profile.
The link you provide in the website field of
your GBP is the first place Google checks
to make sure your Profile is up to date.
How to optimize for it:
Ensure the business information listed on
your GBP matches that listed on your
website.
15. HTML NAP
Matching GBP NAP
What it is:
Local SEOs have noticed that the more rich
your Google Business Profile is, the better it
ranks.
This makes sense considering the CTR and
other engagement factors that Googleâ€™s
algorithm takes into consideration.
The more content there is on your Profile, the
more time people will spend scrolling and
clicking things on it, the more signals
Google will get that your Profile is
interesting to searchers.
How to optimize for it:
Fill out every single section on your Profile,
and add new content (Photos, Videos,
Posts) to it regularly to keep people
interested and engaged.
16. Completeness of
GBP
What it is:
As mentioned earlier, the page you link to in
the website field of your GBP is the first
place Google will look for information about
your business.
Therefore, you need to optimize your GBP
landing page title tag to reflect what you
do and where you do it.
How to optimize for it:
Write a title tag that includes your most
valuable category and location keywords.
Donâ€™t worry about the length of the title
tag (the 60-character limit is in the
Myths section of the survey).
17. Keywords in GBP
Landing Page Title Tag
What it is:
This factor refers to the presence of city
and/or neighborhood names in your content.
It ensures that Google understands where
your business is located and recommends
it to the appropriate searchers.
How to optimize for it:
Donâ€™t be afraid to be a little repetitive in your
content when it comes to your location.
Mention it in your title tags, page headings,
body of text, internal and external links, etc.
18. Geographic
Keyword Relevance
What it is:
Spam fighting is the act of reporting
competitors who are not following Googleâ€™s
guidelines. You can do this by suggesting
edits to the fields on their Profile that are not
accurate (like removing keywords from their
business name), or reporting them with
Googleâ€™s redressal form.
How to optimize for it:
Keep an eye on your competitors. If someone
suddenly shoots to the top of the rankings
for your search terms, look at their Profile
and report anything that seems fishy, like:
keyword-stuffing the business name
having their address be in the middle of a
parking lot
etc.
19. Removal of spam
GBPs via spam fighting
What it is:
Similarly to the GBP landing page title tag,
Google looks at the headings (H1, H2, H3)
on that page to gain a better understanding
of your business.
How to optimize for it:
Weave your most valuable keywords
(category and geographic) into each
heading of the page.
The example above features â€œmenâ€™s sports
massageâ€, â€œmassage therapyâ€, â€œMidtown
Manhattanâ€, and â€œNew York Cityâ€.
20. Keywords in GBP
Landing Page Headings
What it is:
Google doesnâ€™t want to send searchers to a
closed business. This is why they prioritize
showing GBPs with correctly set hours, and
they cross-reference those hours with the
businessâ€™s website and citations.
How to optimize for it:
List your real hours of operation on your
Profile, and make sure they match those on
your website and other listings. Donâ€™t forget
to set special hours for holidays, etc.
Having incorrect business hours not only may
harm your rankings, but it can also lead to
negative reviews.
21. Proper Hours Set
on GBP
What it is:
The services Google suggests you add to
your Profile can impact your rankings.
How to optimize for it:
Take a look at the services Google suggests
for your Profile and add the ones your
business already offers. You may also want
to consider offering new services based on
Googleâ€™s suggestions if they make sense for
your business.
Bonus tip: Write a description for each
service to increase their conversion power.
22. Presence of GBP
Predefined Services
What it is:
The more people search for your business,
the higher Google is going to rank it.
How to optimize for it:
Other than doing your local SEO tasks and
offering great products and services, there
isnâ€™t much you can do to influence this
factor.
One suggestion would be to not link directly
to your Google Business Profile when
refering people to your business. Instead,
send them a link to a Google search for
your business name.
Note that this tacticâ€™s effectiveness
has not been tested sufficiently.
23. Vol. of Searches for
Business Name
What it is:
Listing services on your GBP is great, but
providing Google with more information
about them via your website is better.
How to optimize for it:
Create a unique, separate page on your
website for each service you offer.
Optimize each page fully: title tags,
headings, body text, images, FAQs,
testimonials, etc.
The more information you provide on your
website about each of the services listed on
your Google Business Profile, the more likely
it is that Google will rank you for searches
mentioning those services.
24. Dedicated Page
for Each Service
What it is:
One of the ways in which Google confirms
that a business is legit and credible is to
look at the sites that link to it.
How to optimize for it:
Collaborate with other established local
businesses in your area.
Participate in and sponsor local events.
Publish content on local blogs and
newspapers.
List your business on industry and
location-relevant directories.
Try to get featured in â€œBest ofâ€ lists.
etc.
