The best practices for achieving high visibility in local search and generative AI search engines can be categorized into the following typical SEO topics:
I. Local SEO: Google Business Profile (GBP) & Proximity
These practices focus on optimizing the Google Business Profile (GBP), which is recognized as the engine that powers local visibility.
Best Practice
Detail and Explanation
Primary Category Optimization
Set your GBP primary category to be hyper-specific, such as "Furnace Repair Service" instead of the broad "HVAC Contractor". If the primary category is set incorrectly, Google may fail to associate the business with its core services, significantly hindering local discovery. This category controls what the business ranks for.
Additional Category Maximization
Add all relevant additional categories, utilizing up to nine available slots to increase the breadth of services the business is visible for. These secondary categories help capture related search queries beyond the main service.
Address Visibility
If eligible, keep the physical address visible, preferring a physical office with signage over a Service-Area Business (SAB) with a hidden address, as hidden addresses tend to rank worse. Google often uses the visible address to establish the ranking centroid, directly impacting proximity.
Media Upload Strategy
Upload real media regularly, including weekly photos from jobs and short 15â€“45 second videos for each service. Videos can autoplay inside Google Maps, providing a major conversion advantage.
Optimize Service/Product Sections
Fully optimize the Products and Services sections by including detailed descriptions and pricing information when applicable. Complete profiles signal thoroughness and provide Google with structured data about the offerings.
Video Integration
Repurpose and post long-form content to YouTube, embed it on your site, and upload it directly to the GBP. This leverages the emerging role of YouTube in Googleâ€™s local relevance graph.
Use Real Driving Directions
Encourage staff to use Google Maps for real driving directions daily, as Google heavily weights these "hard-to-fake" signals, which can result in a measurable ranking lift. Consistent usage of this feature mimics genuine customer behavior, strengthening the listingâ€™s authenticity.
Multi-Location Structure
When managing multiple locations, maintain one centralized website but create individual location pages for each real office, ensuring each office has its own separate GBP. This structure prevents keyword cannibalization while establishing distinct local entities.

II. Local SEO: Review Strategy & Management
Reviews are a primary factor in local SEO, especially concerning recency and engagement.
Best Practice
Detail and Explanation
Prioritize Recency
Aim for a steady weekly flow of reviews, recognizing that a business with 500 recent reviews can outrank one with 5,000 stale reviews. Google rewards listings that appear "active, alive, and trusted right now".
Consistent Outreach
Ask every customer for a review, every time, preferably using an SMS and email combination for maximum reach. Combining these methods increases the likelihood of capturing the customer shortly after service completion.
Encourage Detail and Media
Request longer written reviews and encourage the inclusion of photos and videos. Media and detail provide richer content that both human users and algorithms interpret as higher quality and more credible.
Diversify Review Platforms
Diversify where reviews are collected by directing every fifth review request to another relevant site, such as industry-specific directories. This broadens the businessâ€™s social proof footprint beyond just Google.
Monitor Review Status
Monitor for removed reviews, as Google is running new spam filters that can inadvertently flag legitimate customer feedback. Quick identification of legitimate removals allows for prompt appeals, protecting the businessâ€™s rating.

III. Content Strategy & Architecture (Website Alignment)
The website is crucial as it powers GBP rankings and feeds content to both traditional SEO and Answer Engine Optimization (AEO).
Best Practice
Detail and Explanation
Service Page Siloing
Build dedicated service pages for every major service, and further subservice pages for specific offerings (e.g., Water Heater Repair, Tankless Installation). This thorough structure ensures comprehensive coverage and maps intent accurately.
Structured Topic Siloing
Use structured siloing in architecture: start at the Homepage, link to Service pages, which feed into FAQ clusters, which are then supported by Blog deep dives. This hierarchical structure helps build clear topical authority for search engines.
Integrated Blog Strategy
Blogs must be part of the service silos, extending service page content for deeper coverage and topic expansion, rather than existing as standalone weekly posts. This approach ensures that blog content supports the main commercial pages, increasing relevance and E-E-A-T.
Purposeful Internal Linking
Link every mention of a service within the content to its dedicated page, and build topic clusters using internal links to improve E-E-A-T and aid LLM chunking. Strong internal linking distributes page authority and signals topic relationships clearly to crawlers.
Conversational Question Formatting (AEO)
Rewrite H2/H3 headings as natural-language questions that users are likely to ask. This directly prepares the content for AI Overviews and LLMs, which favor conversational query formats.
Direct Conversational Answers
Place direct, conversational answers immediately below each question heading. Concise answers improve the chance of the content being quoted verbatim by AI systems.
Semantic Richness
Optimize content for semantic richness using related entities, synonyms, and NLP terms, prioritizing this over keyword density. This ensures that content satisfies the underlying intent and related topics, which AI systems reward.
E-E-A-T Signals
Add robust E-E-A-T signals to content, including author bios with credentials, case studies, statistics, and first-hand experience. These signals increase the chance of the page being cited by LLMs by up to 37%.

IV. Technical SEO & Structure
Technical foundational health is non-negotiable for both traditional and LLM crawlers.
Best Practice
Detail and Explanation
Crawlability Verification
Verify that your robots.txt allows access to GPTBot, Googlebot, and Bingbot. Allowing these specific crawlers ensures that generative AI models have access to the latest content for retrieval.
Bing Sitemap Submission
Submit your sitemap to Bing Webmaster Tools, as ChatGPT Search uses the Bing index for its information retrieval. Although Google is the dominant search engine, optimizing for Bing ensures visibility in major LLM products.
Key Content in HTML
Ensure key information is placed in HTML text and not rendered solely via JavaScript or embedded as image-only content. HTML remains the most reliable format for all crawlers, including those used by LLMs.
Schema Markup Implementation
Implement Organization schema sitewide and Article schema on all blog posts to provide entity clarity, brand data, and authorship signals. Schema improves AI comprehension of the content's structure and authorship, increasing the odds of inclusion.
Media Accessibility
Add alt text to every image and provide transcripts or captions for videos. This technical step ensures accessibility for users with disabilities and allows search engines to index non-textual media effectively.
Optimize Help Center Structure
Move help center content from a subdomain to a subdirectory and increase internal linking within that section. Subdirectories typically inherit more authority from the root domain than subdomains, benefiting long-tail AEO.

V. Off-Site Authority, Citations, and AEO Surfaces
Winning in Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) requires getting mentioned across many surfaces, not just ranking #1 on a single page.
Best Practice
Detail and Explanation
Citations and Entity Reinforcement
Update business descriptions across all major directories annually using semantic triples (Who/What/Where). Refreshing descriptions reinforces entity signals and ensures consistent brand data.
White Hat Link Building
Pursue white hat link building methods like local sponsorships with sports teams, charities, and community organizations that result in placement on their "Sponsors" pages. These links are often natural, highly relevant, and safe from penalties.
Genuine Guest Posting
Utilize gray hat strategies like guest post placements, ensuring they are placed on relevant niche sites rather than general article marketplaces. Niche relevance is key for passing genuine authority signals.
Active Reddit Participation
Create real accounts on Reddit and post as an employee, focusing on adding value rather than selling, as LLMs heavily trust authentic Reddit citations. Authentic participation helps content bypass Reddit's moderation designed to kill spam.
YouTube Citation Focus
Create videos, even for "boring," high-LTV B2B topics, because this channel is often underserved, leading to extremely high citation likelihood in generative answers. Video content can capture user intent that text alone cannot, especially for procedural queries.
Control Affiliate Mentions
Control off-site citations by pursuing and potentially buying placements (e.g., through Dotdash Meredith properties) where possible. While expensive, this method provides reliable control over influential brand mentions.
Entity and Reputation Growth
Build enough off-site credibility to consolidate brand identity across the web, earning mentions in established knowledge bases. Building institutional trust often starts with consistent Name, Address, Phone (NAP) data and deep topical coverage.

VI. Content Production & AI Usage Warnings
Modern SEO requires moving beyond generic AI outputs and focusing on human expertise and quality.
Best Practice
Detail and Explanation
Avoid Pure AI Generation
Do not produce fully automated AI-generated content, as this leads to lower rankings, model collapse, and derivative loops where answers converge into meaningless opinions. The most effective content is AI-assisted and human-edited.
Target Predictive Topics
Create content for emerging questions before they generate significant search volume. Anticipating user needs allows the business to establish authority in nascent search spaces before competition arises.
Embrace Programmatic SEO
Use programmatic SEO to build scalable, templated pages (e.g., definitions, comparison tables, calculators). This strategy efficiently captures the long tail of high-volume, low-competition queries.
Focus on Original Insight
Content should always provide information gain, adding new insights and details not easily found elsewhere. LLMs reward non-derivative, high-signal pages over typical rewrites.
