Section 1: Glossary (Canonical Terms)

This section defines all key terminology used throughout the playbook.
These are the canonical definitions that resolve conflicts between
source documents.

Core Concepts

**AI-SEO**

Search Engine Optimization specifically designed for AI-powered answer
engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, Gemini). Focuses on
entity recognition, passage extraction, and quotability rather than
traditional keyword ranking.

**AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)**

The practice of optimizing content for direct answers in AI systems.
Emphasizes BLUF structure (Bottom Line Up Front), semantic chunking, and
QA-style headers to maximize AI citation probability.

**GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)**

Optimization specifically for Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT
and Claude. Prioritizes quotability, entity density, numeric
specificity, and self-contained answer blocks that AI can extract and
synthesize.

**Entity**

A distinct, identifiable thing or concept in the Knowledge Graph
(business, person, service, location, mechanism). Entities have
attributes and relationships. Example: \'SmarketSherpa\' is an entity
with attributes (location: Dallas, services: SEO) and relationships
(worksFor, offers, areaServed).

**Entity Association**

The strength of connection between two entities in the Knowledge Graph.
Strong association means AI models predictably link the entities (e.g.,
\'Dallas Truck Accident\' → \'MR.LAW\'). Built through co-occurrence,
structured data, and citation patterns.

**Knowledge Graph**

Google\'s database of entities and their relationships. Think of it as a
massive network where nodes are entities (businesses, people, concepts)
and edges are relationships (worksFor, locatedIn, expertIn). AI models
query this graph to understand context and recommend authoritative
sources.

Content Architecture Terms

**BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)**

Content structure requirement: first sentence after every H2 header must
directly answer the question in 40-60 words. Critical for AI Relevance
scoring (35% weight in LLM evaluation). Example: Q: \'How much does bee
removal cost?\' A: \'Bee removal in Allen, Texas costs \$150-\$500 for
most residential jobs. Larger hives in walls run \$300-\$800.\'

**Quotability**

The degree to which a content passage can be extracted and cited by AI.
Requirements: 40-80 words, self-contained (no external context needed),
entity-rich opening (business + service + location in first 10 words),
numeric specificity, declarative voice with no hedging.

**Semantic Chunking**

Three-sentence pattern: (1) Claim/Answer - state the fact directly, (2)
Evidence - support with data/statute/location/example, (3) Relevance -
explain why it matters (risk, benefit, local context). This structure
optimizes for AI fluency scoring.

**Voice Modality System**

Three distinct writing tones matched to user intent:

-   **Professor**: Technical/legal content, citation-heavy, neutral. Use
    for Branch 2 (Technical) pages.

-   **Peer**: Comparative content, empathetic, validating. Use for
    Branch 3 (Comparative) pages.

-   **Partner**: Transactional/emergency, directive, confident. Use for
    Root and Branch 1 (Financial) pages.

***CRITICAL:** Choose ONE voice per page. Never mix voices within a
page.*

Technical Terms

**Schema Markup (JSON-LD)**

Structured data code that tells search engines what your content means,
not just what it says. Required types: Organization (global footer),
Person (author bios with hasCredential), LocalBusiness (GBP alignment),
Service (areaServed + offers), FAQPage (FAQ sections).

**NAP (Name, Address, Phone)**

Business identity that must be 100% identical across ALL platforms
(website footer, schema markup, Google Business Profile, citations,
social profiles). Even minor differences (abbreviations, punctuation,
Suite vs Ste) break entity recognition.

**E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trust)**

Google\'s quality framework for YMYL (Your Money Your Life) topics like
legal, medical, financial content. Requirements: visible author
credentials (bar license #s), case results with proof, verifiable
expertise signals, cross-platform corroboration.

**IndexNow**

Protocol for instant URL indexing. Push changes directly to search
engines (Bing direct, Google indirect) rather than waiting for crawlers.
Triggers: new publish, content update, URL change, new backlink
acquired. Implementation: WordPress plugin or API POST to
api.indexnow.org.

**llms.txt**

AI agent instruction file at yourdomain.com/llms.txt (similar to
robots.txt). Markdown format listing primary service pages, pricing,
About/Team/Contact with brief context. Tells ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity
what your site offers and where to find information.

**HTML Density**

Ratio of actual text content vs HTML/CSS/JavaScript code. Target: \>65%
text. Low density means AI wastes tokens reading boilerplate code.
Fixes: semantic HTML (article/nav/aside), externalize CSS/JS, reduce DOM
depth, remove page builder bloat.

**Core Web Vitals**

Google\'s UX metrics: LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) \<2.5s, FID (First
Input Delay) \<100ms, CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) \<0.1. Ranking
factors affecting both traditional SEO and user behavior signals AI
systems monitor.

**Ghost Link**

Backlink visible in Ahrefs but NOT in Bing Webmaster Tools = filtered by
search engines. Indicates low-quality link Google ignores. Action:
Don\'t count in reports, add toxic links to Disavow file. Audit monthly
using Ahrefs vs Bing comparison.

Local SEO Terms

**GBP (Google Business Profile)**

Google\'s local business listing (formerly Google My Business). Primary
ranking factors: Review Velocity (weekly cadence), Visual Saturation
(100+ photos), Primary Category (hyper-specific), Address Visibility
(physical \> hidden), Hard-to-Fake Signals (real driving directions).

**Map Pack (Local 3-Pack)**

Top 3 map listings shown for local queries. Ranking factors: Proximity
to searcher, Review Velocity, Photo/Video Saturation, NAP Consistency,
Primary Category, Engagement Signals (clicks, calls, direction
requests).

**Review Velocity**

Frequency of new reviews. A business with 500 recent reviews outranks
one with 5,000 stale reviews. Target: weekly review cadence. Google
rewards listings appearing \'active right now.\' Implementation: ask
EVERY customer, SMS + email combination.

**Visual Saturation**

Photo/video quantity and quality on GBP. Target: 100+ photos minimum.
Mix: 20 exterior, 30 team, 30 project/job, 20 equipment. All must be
geotagged (EXIF GPS data). Videos (15-45 seconds) autoplay in Maps,
providing major conversion advantage.

**Hard-to-Fake Signals**

User actions difficult to manipulate: real driving directions via Google
Maps, actual phone calls from Maps, website visits from GBP. Google
heavily weights these over easily-gamed signals like check-ins or
reviews.

**Primary Category**

Single most important GBP signal. Must be hyper-specific, not generic.
Example: \'Furnace Repair Service\' (specific) vs \'HVAC Contractor\'
(too broad). Controls what business ranks for. Set incorrectly = Google
fails to associate business with core services.

**Centroid**

Geographic center point of a city or search area. Proximity to centroid
affects rankings for searches outside city (e.g., searching \'Chicago
plumber\' from LA) or searches mentioning city name. Physical address
near downtown/centroid provides ranking advantage.

Authority Stack Terms

**Google Authority Stack (GATS)**

Interconnected network of Google properties (Google Drive, Google Sites,
Google My Maps, Google Docs) that reinforce entity authority. Benefits:
Fast indexing, trusted domain authority, link equity flowing to Money
Site. Implementation: 4 phases over 6-8 hours.

**Money Site**

Your primary business website (e.g., smarketsherpa.ai or mrlaw.com).
Receives authority from Google Authority Stack and Tier 2 backlinks
indirectly. Never send low-quality links directly to Money Site.

**Drive Stack**

Phase 1 of GATS. Public Google Drive folder containing: Google Doc
(1,000 words + NAP), PDF (converted from Doc), Google Sheet (keyword
list), Google Slides (5-slide deck), geotagged photos. All assets
interlink and point to Money Site.

**Map Stack**

Phase 2 of GATS. Google My Maps showing business location, driving
directions from 3 landmarks, 500-word description with keywords and
links to Money Site + Drive folder.

**Link Loop**

Interconnection pattern where all Google properties link to each other:
Drive Doc → Google Site → My Map → Google Site → Drive Doc. Creates
authority flow within Google ecosystem before pointing to Money Site.

**Tier 2 Backlinks**

Links sent ONLY to Google Site (not Money Site) to trigger indexing and
amplify stack authority. Protects Money Site from potential penalties.
Source: directories, web 2.0s, social bookmarks (10-50 links minimum).

Operations Terms

**Rage Click**

User behavior: rapidly clicking same element 3+ times in \<2 seconds,
indicating frustration. Detected by Microsoft Clarity. Most common:
broken tel: links (phone number displayed as text instead of clickable
link). Causes 60-80% mobile lead loss.

**LSA (Local Services Ads)**

Google\'s pay-per-lead platform for home services. Appears above Map
Pack. Ranking factors: Review count, Response time, Background check
completion. Critical: Dispute invalid leads within 3-day window or pay
for spam.

**RevFlow™**

Automated lead capture and conversion system. Components: RevVoice
Advisor (24/7 AI phone answering), RevNurture Follow (instant SMS after
form submission), RevTrust Pulse (automated review requests), RevClient
Reignite (database reactivation).

**Crush/Meh/Fail Portfolio Model**

Expected outcome distribution for rank-and-rent microsites: ⅓ Crush
(consistent leads, strong rankings), ⅓ Meh (some leads, okay rankings),
⅓ Fail (few leads, poor rankings). Baked into economics - don\'t try to
fix every site. Build more instead.

Section 2: Source Integration & Conflict Resolution

This playbook consolidates 9 source documents totaling 200+ pages. This
section documents how redundancies were eliminated and conflicts
resolved.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Major Conflicts Resolved

Content Quality Standards

**Conflict:** Doc 1/3 Rank Expand methodology accepts \'thin content\'
(800-1000 words, template-driven). Doc 6 AI-SEO Guide requires strict
quality (BLUF, quotability, entity density).

**Resolution:** Doc 6 is mandatory. Doc 5 gap analysis confirms: \'60%
research + 0% AI writing guidelines = 0% AI visibility.\' Doc 1 Rank
Expand prompts enhanced with Doc 6\'s 7-layer stack (Base + Context +
Structure + Component + GEO + Entity + Trust). Maintains production
velocity while achieving AI citation capability.

Authority Building Approaches

**Conflict:** Doc 3 teaches minimal backlinks (\'Authority is
citations + NAP, not links\'). Doc 8/9 teach comprehensive link building
(GATS + Tier 2 backlinks + 12 outreach scripts).

**Resolution:** Both approaches work for different contexts. Doc 3
strategy valid for portfolio microsites where speed \> perfection. Doc
8/9 strategy required for competitive verticals (Legal YMYL, B2B SaaS).
This playbook documents BOTH, labeled by use case.

Voice & Tone Guidance

**Conflict:** Doc 1 says \'friendly tone throughout.\' Doc 6 defines 3
distinct voice modalities (Professor/Peer/Partner) with strict selection
rules.

**Resolution:** Doc 6 voice system is canonical. \'Friendly\' is too
vague. Intent-first voice selection mandatory: Emergency/Transactional =
Partner, Technical/Legal = Professor, Comparative/Pain = Peer. ONE voice
per page.

Integration Strategy

Each section of this playbook indicates source documents with
superscript tags:

-   \[Executive\]: For business owners, agency principals,
    decision-makers

-   \[Technical\]: For developers, system administrators

-   \[SEO Lead\]: For SEO managers, strategists

-   \[Content Team\]: For writers, editors, content managers

-   \[Ops\]: For operations managers, VAs, coordinators

Section 3: Executive Summary & The 2026 Landscape

*\[Executive\]*

What Changed in Search

The era of \'10 blue links\' is over. In 2026, users don\'t click search
results---they consume AI-generated answers directly. Platforms like
Google\'s AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini now act as the
\'First Page\' of the internet.

**The Strategic Shift:**

-   **Old SEO (2015-2023):** Rank a specific URL for a specific keyword.
    Metric: Position #1-10. Tactic: Keyword density, backlinks.

-   **AI-SEO (2025-2026):** Establish entity association so AI
    recommends your brand. Metric: AI Citation Share (how often
    mentioned in answers). Tactic: Semantic context, entity schema,
    quotability.

The 6-Surface Monopoly Model

Success is no longer measured by ranking #1 for a keyword. Success means
appearing on ALL surfaces a user encounters when searching for your
category.

**The 6 Surfaces:**

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Surface**       **How to Win**          **Key Strategy**
  ----------------- ----------------------- ------------------------------
  1\. Paid Ads      Click-fraud prevention, Instant visibility for
                    landing page speed      high-intent keywords

  2\. AI Overview   Schema density, direct  Generative text box at top of
  (SGE)             answer format           results

  3\. Local Map     Review velocity, visual Top 3 GBP listings with map
  Pack              saturation              

  4\. Organic       Semantic branching,     Traditional blue link rankings
  Listings          content depth           

  5\. Video         VideoObject schema,     YouTube/TikTok shorts in
  Carousel          transcripts             results

  6\. Third-Party   Piggyback protocol,     \'Best Of\' lists,
  Citations         outreach scripts        directories, Reddit
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Success Target:** Brand presence on 4+ surfaces for each primary
keyword.

Expected Outcomes

When this playbook is implemented fully, expect these measurable results
within 90 days:

-   **30-50% AI Citation Share:** Your brand mentioned in 30-50% of
    AI-generated answers for primary keywords (measured via manual
    testing in ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI)

-   **Top 3 Map Pack:** Consistent Top 3 position for 80-200 local
    keywords

-   **12-18% Conversion Rate:** Lead capture rate (calls + forms) from
    organic traffic

-   **\>65% HTML Density:** Technical health score ensuring AI can
    efficiently crawl content

-   **100% Mobile Pass:** Core Web Vitals meeting Google\'s \'Good\'
    thresholds (LCP \<2.5s, FID \<100ms, CLS \<0.1)

Resource Requirements

**Team Requirements:**

-   **SEO Lead:** Strategic oversight, competitor analysis, technical QA
    (15-20 hrs/month)

-   **Content Team:** Writers trained on BLUF/voice modalities (40-60
    hrs/month for 20-30 pages)

-   **Developer:** Schema implementation, technical fixes (10-15 hrs
    initial setup, 5 hrs/month maintenance)

-   **Operations:** GBP management, review responses, QA checks (20-30
    hrs/month)

**Technology Stack:**

-   Required: Google Search Console, Google Business Profile, Microsoft
    Clarity (rage click tracking), Ahrefs or SEMrush
    (competitor/backlink analysis)

-   Recommended: IndexNow (instant indexing), CallRail (call tracking),
    DataForSEO (LLM Mentions API for AI citation tracking)

Section 4: Mental Models - How AI Answers Are Built

*\[Technical\] \[SEO Lead\]*

The LLM Evaluation Pipeline

Understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) select and synthesize
content is critical for optimization. When a user asks a question, the
AI doesn\'t search the entire web---it evaluates pre-indexed passages
through a 5-stage pipeline.

Stage 1: Retrieval (Semantic Search)

The AI performs semantic search across indexed content, retrieving
20-100 candidate passages that match the query intent (not just
keywords). Passages are typically 100-300 words.

Stage 2: Evaluation Scoring

Each retrieved passage receives a weighted score across 5 dimensions:

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Dimension**     **Weight**   **What It Measures**
  ----------------- ------------ -----------------------------------------
  Relevance         **35%**      How directly does this answer the
                                 question? BLUF structure maximizes this
                                 score.

  Authority         **25%**      Entity density, credentials, citations to
                                 primary sources (gov/edu).

  Fluency           **20%**      Clean structure with clear semantic
                                 boundaries. Semantic chunking improves
                                 score.

  Freshness         **12%**      Visible dates, schema dateModified,
                                 recent publication.

  Corroboration     **8%**       Alignment with consensus across multiple
                                 sources.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Formula:** Citation Score = (Relevance × 0.35) + (Authority × 0.25) +
(Fluency × 0.20) + (Freshness × 0.12) + (Corroboration × 0.08)

Stage 3: Ranking & Selection

Top 5-10 passages (highest scores) are selected for potential inclusion
in the answer.

Stage 4: Synthesis

The AI combines selected passages, removing redundancy and resolving
conflicts. This is why quotable, self-contained blocks perform better
than long-form prose.

Stage 5: Output with Attribution

The final answer is generated with citations. Different platforms handle
attribution differently: Google (inline links), Perplexity (numbered
citations), ChatGPT (prose attribution).

Key Implications for Content Strategy

-   **Optimize for Passage Extraction:** Goal is not \'page ranking\'
    but \'passage extraction.\' Content must be engineered as quotable
    blocks.

-   **Relevance is King:** 35% weight on how directly you answer the
    question. BLUF structure non-negotiable.

-   **Authority Requires Proof:** 25% weight means generic \'we are
    experienced\' fails. Need license numbers, case results, citations.

-   **Freshness Beats Age:** Content updated 6 months ago outranks
    \'better\' content from 2 years ago.

SECTION 5: STRATEGIC FOUNDATIONS

*\[Audience: Executive + SEO Lead + Content Team\]*

This section covers the five core strategic principles that
differentiate AI-SEO from legacy SEO tactics.

5.1 Entity-First Strategy

Traditional SEO optimized for keyword strings. AI-SEO optimizes for
Entity Association---the strength of connection between your brand
entity and topic entities in the Knowledge Graph.

The Knowledge Graph

Google stores information as a graph of nodes (entities) connected by
edges (relationships). When a user asks \'best truck accident lawyer
Dallas,\' the AI calculates probability scores for which entity to
recommend based on:

-   Co-occurrence frequency (brand + topic mentions together)

-   Sentiment (positive context around mentions)

-   Authority (citations from trusted sources)

Implementation

**Narrow & Deep Approach:** Focus on ONE entity per 90-day sprint.
Publishing 50 blog posts across 50 topics dilutes entity signals.
Publishing 50 posts on ONE topic (e.g., truck accidents) saturates the
Knowledge Graph with your brand-topic association.

5.2 Authority Signals & E-E-A-T

For YMYL (Your Money Your Life) topics---legal, medical,
financial---Google applies trust filters. Content without verifiable
credentials gets suppressed.

Required Authority Signals

-   **Credentials Display:** Bar numbers, license IDs, certifications
    visible on author bios

-   **Proof of Work:** Case results database, client testimonials,
    project portfolios

-   **Schema Markup:** Person schema with hasCredential property linking
    to verified credentials

-   **Editorial Standards:** Published \'Content Standards\' page
    explaining review process

5.3 Topical Authority Architecture

Build content clusters around pillar pages using the 4-Layer Semantic
Model.

The 4-Layer Semantic Model

-   **Layer 1 (Root):** Transactional pillar page (e.g., \'Dallas Truck
    Accident Lawyer\')

-   **Layer 2 (Financial Branch):** ROI intent---settlement calculators,
    cost guides, fee structures

-   **Layer 3 (Technical Branch):** Expertise intent---regulations,
    processes, compliance requirements

-   **Layer 4 (Comparative Branch):** Evaluation intent---\'vs\' pages,
    symptoms, alternatives

**Internal Linking Rule:** All branch pages link UP to root with
keyword-rich anchors. Root links OUT to all branches.

5.4 Coining the Mechanism (Proprietary Naming)

Force branded search volume by inventing proprietary names for standard
services. This psychological tactic creates a \'digital catcher\'s
mitt\'---users Google your specific term, sending massive behavioral
signals.

The Pattern

-   **Identify the Fear:** What invisible risk keeps prospects awake?
    (e.g., \'Black box data disappearing after crashes\')

-   **Name the Solution:** Create a trademark-style name (e.g.,
    \'ECM-Preservation Protocol™\')

-   **Withhold Details:** In ads/posts, mention the mechanism exists but
    don\'t explain it---tell them to Google it

-   **Build Landing Page:** Create dedicated page explaining the
    mechanism with comparison charts

Examples by Vertical

-   **Legal:** \'ECM-Preservation Protocol™\' for truck crash black box
    data

-   **Trades:** \'Thermal-Guard Audit™\' for electrical safety
    inspections

-   **SaaS:** \'Zero-Loss Migration Framework™\' for database
    transitions

5.5 Demand Capture vs. Demand Creation

Most SEO focuses on capturing existing search demand. AI-SEO includes
creating new demand through offline assets.

The Sticker Strategy (Trades)

Physical equipment installed in homes becomes your most valuable SEO
asset. Replace generic service stickers with \'curiosity stickers\' that
drive branded searches.

**Old:** \'Service by Leon Electric: 555-0100\' (ignored)

**New:** \'Certified Safe via Arc-Defense™ Protocol • System Tripped?
Google Leon Electric Trip Guide\'

When homeowner\'s power goes out, they Google the branded term, sending
massive user-behavior signals that the brand is the authority.

SECTION 6: CONTENT ARCHITECTURE

*\[Audience: Content Team + SEO Lead\]*

These writing protocols transform standard content into
AI-citation-worthy passages. Every protocol is mandatory for AI
visibility.

6.1 BLUF Structure (Bottom Line Up Front)

**Rule:** The first sentence after every H2 must directly answer the
user\'s question in 40-60 words. No throat-clearing, no context-setting
preambles.

Examples

**❌ Wrong:** \'When it comes to bee removal, many homeowners wonder
about the cost. There are several factors to consider\...\'

**✓ Right:** \'Bee removal in Allen, Texas costs \$150-\$500 for most
residential jobs. Larger hives in walls run \$300-\$800.\'

6.2 QA-Style H2 Headings

**Rule:** Headers must mirror natural language questions that users
actually search. This aligns with how LLMs are trained on QA pairs.

Examples

**❌ Wrong:** \'Pricing\' or \'Our Services\' or \'About Our Process\'

**✓ Right:** \'How Much Does Bee Removal Cost in Allen, TX?\' or \'What
Services Does Allen Bee Rescue Offer?\'

6.3 The 60-Word Snippet Constraint

Provide a concise, 40-60 word block immediately under each H2. This
becomes both your featured snippet candidate and the canonical answer
chunk LLMs will reuse.

6.4 Three-Sentence Semantic Chunking

After the initial snippet, structure remaining content in 3-sentence
chunks following this pattern:

-   **Sentence 1 (Claim):** State the fact or recommendation directly

-   **Sentence 2 (Evidence):** Support with data, statute, location, or
    specific example

-   **Sentence 3 (Relevance):** Explain why this matters---risk,
    benefit, or local context

6.5 Voice Modality System

**Critical Rule:** One dominant voice per page. Do not mix voices across
sections.

The Three Voices

-   **Professor (High Authority, Low Emotion):**
    Technical/legal/regulatory content. Citation-heavy. \'According
    to\...,\' \'The statute states\...\'

    -   *Use for:* Branch 2 (Technical) pages

-   **Peer (High Empathy, Moderate Authority):** Comparative content,
    pain-driven queries. Validating, side-by-side comparisons. \'Many
    homeowners feel\...\'

    -   *Use for:* Branch 3 (Comparative) pages

-   **Partner (Directive, Confident, Action-Oriented):** Root
    transactional pages, pricing, emergency. Commands, urgency. \'Call
    now,\' \'Don\'t wait\'

    -   *Use for:* Root pages and Branch 1 (Financial) pages

6.6 The Specificity Hierarchy

Home services purchases are high-stakes. Generic content signals \'we
could be anyone.\' Specific content signals \'we are real, local, and
accountable.\'

The Hierarchy (Most to Least Powerful)

-   **1. Names:** \'Marcus Chen, our lead specialist\' beats \'our
    experienced team\'

-   **2. Numbers:** \'847 hives relocated in 2024\' beats \'hundreds of
    removals\'

-   **3. Locations:** \'Stacy Ridge subdivision\' beats \'the Allen
    area\'

-   **4. Timeframes:** \'Within 2 hours\' beats \'fast response\'

-   **5. Credentials:** \'Texas Registration #TX-BK-2847\' beats \'fully
    licensed\'

The High-Resolution Test

Could a competitor copy-paste this and use it by just changing the
company name? If yes, it\'s not specific enough.

6.7 The Quotability Framework

LLMs quote specific passages. \'Quotable\' content is engineered for
extraction:

-   **Self-contained:** Each paragraph answers one question completely

-   **Optimal length:** 40-80 words. Shorter lacks context; longer needs
    truncation

-   **Entity-rich opening:** First 10 words contain primary entity

-   **Numeric specificity:** At least one concrete number per block

-   **Declarative:** Active voice, present tense, no hedging (\'may,\'
    \'could\')

6.8 Multi-Format Coverage

Different query types demand different content formats. Each page should
include multiple formats:

-   **BLUF Paragraphs:** For direct answer queries and featured snippets

-   **Numbered Steps:** For \'how to\' queries with HowTo schema

-   **Comparison Tables:** For \'vs\' queries and evaluation intent

-   **FAQ Blocks:** For PAA (People Also Ask) and voice search with
    FAQPage schema

SECTION 7: EDITORIAL SYSTEM & QUALITY CONTROL

*\[Audience: Content Team + Ops\]*

7.1 Content Brief Template

Every piece of content must start with a structured brief to prevent AI
slop and ensure strategic alignment.

Required Brief Elements

-   **Target Keyword:** Primary keyword (from research phase)

-   **Layer Assignment:** Root, Financial, Technical, or Comparative

-   **Voice Selection:** Professor, Peer, or Partner (with
    justification)

-   **Core Question:** The H1 phrased as a question

-   **BLUF Answer:** 40-60 word direct answer to core question

-   **Supporting H2s:** 3-5 H2 questions that support the H1

-   **Entity Requirements:** Specific names, numbers, locations,
    credentials to include

-   **Internal Links:** 3-5 target pages to link to with suggested
    anchors

7.2 GEO Quality Checklist (10-Point)

Before publishing, content must pass all 10 checkpoints:

-   **□ BLUF Compliance:** First sentence after H2 directly answers the
    question

-   **□ Entity Density:** 5+ distinct entities (business, location,
    service, person, mechanism)

-   **□ Quotable Blocks:** 3+ self-contained 40-60 word paragraphs

-   **□ Numeric Specificity:** 5+ concrete numbers throughout content

-   **□ Local Proof:** 3+ neighborhoods/landmarks verified via Maps

-   **□ Mechanism Presence:** Proprietary method mentioned 2+ times (if
    applicable)

-   **□ Voice Consistency:** Single voice modality throughout (no
    mixing)

-   **□ Schema Alignment:** On-page claims match structured data

-   **□ Multi-Format:** 2+ bullet lists, 1 table, 1 numbered sequence

-   **□ Uniqueness:** Content differs from other pages (Row 5 vs Row 15
    test)

7.3 Content Refresh SOP

Freshness signal decays after 6 months. Implement quarterly refresh
cycles:

Refresh Triggers

-   Content \>6 months old showing declining rankings

-   Regulatory or legal changes affecting accuracy

-   Competitor content outranking due to fresher dates

Refresh Actions

-   Update statistics to current year (e.g., \'847 hives relocated in
    2024\' → 2025)

-   Add new case study or example from past quarter

-   Update schema dateModified field

-   Trigger IndexNow to force immediate re-crawl

-   Do NOT change URL or title (preserves link equity)

7.4 AI vs. Human Content Governance

AI can draft, but humans must verify. The \'Zero-Hallucination
Protocol\':

-   Create ChatGPT Project with uploaded Brand Voice Guide, Price
    Sheets, and Legal Docs

-   Every prompt must reference uploaded files: \'Reference the uploaded
    Brand Voice Guide\...\'

-   Human expert (attorney/engineer) verifies all facts before
    publishing

-   Run Originality.ai check to ensure \<30% AI detection score

SECTION 8: TECHNICAL FOUNDATIONS

*\[Audience: Technical + Developer\]*

These technical protocols ensure the site is readable by both Google
crawlers and LLM agents. Missing any of these creates blind spots in AI
visibility.

8.1 Entity Schema Markup

Schema (JSON-LD) is the language AI models use to understand entity
relationships. Required implementations:

Organization Schema (Site-Wide)

Establishes root entity in Knowledge Graph. Place in site footer:

\@type: LegalService or LocalBusiness

**Required fields:** name, url, logo, telephone, address (with geo
coordinates), sameAs (social profiles)

Person Schema (Author/Attorney Bios)

Links individual to organization and credentials:

\@type: Person with worksFor, hasCredential, alumniOf, knowsAbout

**Critical:** hasCredential property must link to Bar
License/Certification with identifier field

Service Schema (Per Service Page)

\@type: Service with provider, areaServed, offers (price range)

FAQPage Schema

For AI Overview eligibility. Wrap FAQ sections with FAQPage schema
containing mainEntity array of Question/Answer objects.

8.2 IndexNow Protocol

Waiting for natural crawls is obsolete. IndexNow pushes URL updates to
search engines instantly.

-   **Install:** IndexNow WordPress plugin or Cloudflare integration

-   **Configure:** Auto-ping on publish and update

-   **Verify:** Upload API key text file to root directory

-   **Impact:** Content indexes in minutes vs. days, enabling
    newsjacking strategies

8.3 llms.txt Protocol

The robots.txt equivalent for AI agents. Creates clean Markdown map of
site\'s truth.

Implementation

-   Create plain text file: llms.txt

-   Use strict Markdown (no HTML/CSS)

-   Upload to root directory: domain.com/llms.txt

Required Sections

-   H1: Brand Name + one-sentence value prop

-   H2: Core Services (links to pillar pages)

-   H2: Pricing/Fees (link to transparent pricing)

-   H2: Company Info (About/Contact links)

8.4 Core Web Vitals Optimization

AI models and users both abandon slow sites. Target scores:

-   **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):** \<2.5s on mobile

    -   Fix: Convert PNG/JPG to WebP, lazy-load below-fold images,
        preload hero image

-   **FID (First Input Delay):** \<100ms

    -   Fix: Defer non-critical JavaScript, minimize third-party scripts

-   **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift):** \<0.1

    -   Fix: Specify image dimensions, preload fonts

8.5 Mobile Conversion Infrastructure

**Critical P1:** 60-80% of leads come from mobile. Broken mobile = lost
revenue.

The tel: Link Protocol

ALL phone numbers must use active tel: links with event tracking:

\<a href=\"tel:+12145550100\" onclick=\"gtag(\'event\',
\'click_to_call\')\"\>Call Now\</a\>

Sticky Mobile CTA

Fixed-position footer on mobile with prominent Call button in thumb zone
(bottom 30% of screen).

Microsoft Clarity Rage Click Audit

Weekly check for rage clicks (3+ rapid clicks) indicating frustration.
Most common issue: non-linked phone numbers.

8.6 HTML Density & Code Hygiene

AI tokens are expensive. Sites with \>80% code bloat get deprioritized.

-   **Target:** \>65% text-to-code ratio

-   **Fix:** Replace generic \<div\> tags with semantic HTML
    (\<article\>, \<section\>, \<aside\>)

-   **Fix:** Strip unnecessary wrapper DIVs from page builders

8.7 Google Authority Stack (GATS) Implementation

Leverage Google\'s own properties to build authority. Google trusts its
own platforms.

Phase 1: Drive Stack

-   Create Google Doc with NAP + services overview, linking to Money
    Site

-   Upload PDF version of same content

-   Create Google Sheet with service pricing table, linking to Money
    Site

-   Create Google Slides presentation with service overview

-   Organize all in single Google Drive folder with clear naming

Phase 2: Map Stack

-   Create Google My Maps with service area boundaries and office
    location

-   Add pins for key neighborhoods served

-   Include driving directions from each pin to office

-   Link Map description to Money Site and Drive Stack docs

Phase 3: Google Site

-   Create Google Site (not Money Site) with service pages

-   Embed Drive Stack docs, Map, and link to Money Site

-   Create interlinks between all Google properties (the \'Link Loop\')

Critical Rules

-   **NAP Consistency:** Exact match across all properties

-   **No Direct Tier 2:** External backlinks point to Google Site ONLY,
    never Money Site

-   **Public Visibility:** All Google properties set to public/anyone
    with link
