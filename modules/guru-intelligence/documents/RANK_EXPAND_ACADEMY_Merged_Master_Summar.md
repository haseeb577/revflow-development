RANK EXPAND ACADEMY Merged Master Summary as SOP


Below is a merged â€œmaster summaryâ€ of the video, structured as a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for building and scaling a profitable microsite portfolio.
You can treat this as the canonical â€œHow to Build & Scale Local Micrositesâ€ playbook.

MICROSITE PORTFOLIO SOP
 Version: 1.0
 Owner: [You / Program Lead]
 Applies to: Internal team + VAs + students

Purpose & Outcomes


This SOP translates the videoâ€™s insights into a repeatable system for:
Building local lead-gen microsites cheaply and quickly.


Ranking them using local SEO fundamentals, tech performance, and conversions.


Running a portfolio where ~â…“ crush, ~â…“ are meh, ~â…“ failâ€”and the economics still work.


Avoiding perfectionism and scaling via VAs and templates.


Primary success metrics:
Cost-per-microsite in the $10â€“$50 range.


Portfolio performance: for every 3 sites, at least 1 â€œwinnerâ€ (consistent leads).


Lead volume: steady increase in calls/forms from the portfolio.


Build time per site: â‰¤ 5 hours including VA work (after system is dialed).



Key Principles (Merged Master Summary)


Thin/generic content is fine if semantics are strong.


Typical main pages: 800â€“1,000+ words; location pages longer.


Use tight headings, topical depth via internal links, and local/entity relevance.


Branding can be minimal; â€œgeneric but solidâ€ wins if the structure is right.


EMD + basic entity/brand signals is the 80/20 for micro sites.


Exact Match Domains (EMDs) or strong partial matches work very well.


Heavy branding, social profiles, and big link campaigns are not required.


Citations + NAP integrity are the core.


Authority is more than backlinks.


Citations, internal linking, fast load times, and engagement (time on site, calls) drive â€œauthority.â€


Google seems to reward sites that satisfy users quickly, not just sites with backlinks.


Be assertive with on-page optimization (especially for local).


Itâ€™s normal for local sites to have keyword-heavy H1s, titles, and headings.


Over-optimization is less common than under-optimization in local.


Fear of â€œpenaltiesâ€ often leads to weak, vague pages.


Real micro sites have depth (not 1â€“5 page landers).


Target ~20â€“50+ pages per site (often 30â€“50 in their system).


Mix of: home, core services, supporting services, service areas/locations, contact, FAQ/support.


This creates topical and local depth that Google can trust.


Local relevance is vital but can be 80/20â€™d.


Must-haves: clear service areas, service area details, embedded maps, local entities.


Nice-to-haves: local outbound links, extra local reference content.


You donâ€™t need a giant â€œlocal blogâ€ library to win local queries.


Technical performance is a massive lever.


Use a fast stack (e.g., flat CMS or very lean setup).


Goal: pages load almost instantly on desktop and mobile.


Solve speed and Core Web Vitals once at the platform/template level.


Near-duplicate content between sites is less deadly than people think.


Many microsites share similar structure, headings, and prompt outputs.


They still rank because core entities differ (NAP, images, â€œAboutâ€ content).


Google appears to care more about entity uniqueness than perfectly unique prose.


Conversion optimization is non-optional.


Mandatory: phone number above the fold (hero + nav) and sticky mobile CTA.


Clean, professional, non-spammy design for trust.


Use photos; add testimonials/reviews once GBP exists.


Build â†’ Index â†’ Authority â†’ Expand is roughly the right sequence.


Step 1: Build core pages.


Step 2: Ensure indexing.


Step 3: Send authority (citations, entity consistency).


Step 4: Expand topical clusters if needed (extra service/location/support pages, not necessarily blogs).


GBP (Google Business Profile) is a cheat code, not a prerequisite.


Most of their 78 sites rank without GBP.


When added to one EMD placed in the city center, GBP yielded ~5x lead flow.


If you have GBP: categories, consistent NAP, photos, and reviews matter.


Keyword selection is make-or-break.


Avoid hyper-competitive â€œplumber + big cityâ€ head terms.


Target sub-niches and less obvious local terms where EMD + micro site can realistically win.


Minimal tracking beats complex analytics.


Must-track: calls and form submissions.


Nice-to-have: rankings early on, but rank trackers are expensive and low ROI long-term.


Money/time spent on micro-optimizing rankings is usually better invested in more sites.


The biggest real pitfall: perfectionism and overthinking.


Over-analysis, attachment to one site, and endless tweaking kill momentum.


Since sites are cheap, the rational move is to build more, not to over-fix one.


VAs + systems unlock scale.


One VA built most of their 78 sites; a second VA continued from there.


Founders/operators:


Figure out the recipe.


Build a few sites themselves.


Then hand off to VAs with SOPs and QA.



End-to-End Workflow (SOP Steps)


Step 1 â€“ Choose Niche & Keywords
Owner: You / Strategy Lead
Identify local service niches with clear commercial intent.


Look for â€œcalls and contracts,â€ not informational traffic.


Prefer sub-niches (e.g., specialized services) over broad generic terms.


Evaluate keyword difficulty & intent.


Avoid obvious bloodbaths (â€œ[service] [big city]â€ with huge competition).


Prioritize:


Reasonable search volume.


Clear local intent.


Fewer entrenched national brands.


Decide on 3 initial sites (cohort).


Aim for 3 sites in related but distinct sub-niches or geos.


Treat them as small experiments, not guaranteed home runs.


Deliverable: â€œNiche & Keyword Sheetâ€ with at least 3 target keyword sets and notes.

Step 2 â€“ Domain & Entity Setup
Owner: You (or VA with clear rules)
Acquire domains.


Prefer EMDs or strong partial matches.


Ensure each domain can represent a distinct entity (business name).


Define entity details for each site.


Business name (aligned with domain).


Address (city/region appropriate; think about where youâ€™d â€œdropâ€ the pin).


Phone number (unique per site for tracking).


Short â€œAboutâ€ story (unique tone and details).


Document NAP for each site in a central sheet.


Deliverable: Entity & Domain sheet with NAP, domain, and main keyword per site.

Step 3 â€“ Site Architecture & Page Plan
Owner: You â†’ then standardized for VA
Use a standard architecture pattern per microsite:


Home page.


Core service page(s).


Supporting service pages (variations, sub-services).


Location/service area pages (for each city/region).


Contact page.


Optional: FAQ/support pages.


Target page count: ~20â€“50+ pages, often ending up in the 30â€“50 range.


Map each page to:


Primary keyword.


Secondary/local modifiers.


Internal linking targets (where it should link to and from).


Deliverable: Site map + page list with keyword assignments and internal linking plan.

Step 4 â€“ Content Creation & On-Page SEO
Owner: You (first few sites), then VA using templates/prompts
For each main page:


Aim for 800â€“1,000+ words (location pages longer).


Include:


Clear H1 with main keyword.


H2/H3s that reinforce variations and relevance.


Local references (city, neighborhoods, landmarks).


A clear call-to-action (phone, form).


Donâ€™t fear repetition.


Itâ€™s fine if H2s and content are keyword-heavy for local.


Avoid obvious spam (nonsense lists or unreadable text), but donâ€™t under-optimized.


Build internal linking for topical depth.


Each service page links to relevant location pages and vice versa.


Use internal links to create clusters (Service A cluster, Service B cluster, etc.).


Templates & prompts.


Lock in 1â€“2 â€œprompt recipesâ€ or content templates that VAs can use repeatedly.


Expect near-duplicate structureâ€”thatâ€™s acceptable if entities differ.


QA Checklist (per page):
H1 includes main keyword + city/region (where applicable).


Word count meets minimum target.


Content mentions service area and local entities where relevant.


At least 2â€“3 internal links to other relevant pages.


CTA clearly visible.



Step 5 â€“ Local Relevance & Service Area Implementation
Owner: VA following checklist
Add service area details on relevant pages.


List cities/areas served.


Brief, natural mentions of neighborhoods or suburbs.


Embed maps.


Use a map embed on key pages (Home, main service, contact).


Center the pin in a sensible area (e.g., city center or main service area).


Consider local outbound links (optional).


Link to relevant local associations or resources when it makes sense.


Donâ€™t overdo it; a few well-placed links are enough.


QA Checklist:
Service area is clearly described.


Map embed works and is relevant.


Local entities (city, neighborhoods) appear in copy naturally.



Step 6 â€“ Tech Setup & Performance
Owner: Tech Lead / You (once), then VA uses template
Choose and standardize on a fast stack.


Flat CMS or very lightweight theme if you must use WordPress.


Avoid heavy page builders and plugin bloat.


Optimize performance at template level.


Compressed images.


Basic caching.


CDN if appropriate.


Minimal scripts.


Test sample pages.


Ensure near-instant first paint on desktop and mobile.


Address any major performance issues before scaling.


QA Checklist:
Homepage and key service page load in ~1â€“2 seconds or less.


No obvious layout shifts or blocking scripts.


Core Web Vitals are acceptable.



Step 7 â€“ Citations, NAP & Entity Building
Owner: VA (once SOP is stable)
Create baseline citations for each microsite.


Use the NAP defined in your entity sheet.


Prioritize the main local directories/platforms relevant to that region/niche.


Confirm NAP integrity.


Ensure NAP is identical across: site, citations, GBP (if used).


Fix inconsistencies.


Minimal â€œbrandâ€ signals.


Logo and consistent business name on all pages.


Simple â€œAboutâ€ content that feels like a real local business.


QA Checklist:
NAP on site matches top citations exactly.


At least a defined baseline number of citations created (e.g., 10â€“20).



Step 8 â€“ Conversion Optimization
Owner: Template Designer / VA implementing template
Phone & CTA placement.


Phone number in header/nav.


Prominent phone and/or â€œCall Nowâ€ CTA in hero.


Sticky CTA bar on mobile (â€œCall Nowâ€ / â€œGet a Quoteâ€).


Design & trust.


Clean, modern design.


No clutter, no obvious â€œspam templateâ€ feel.


Use real-looking photos.


Forms.


Simple, above-the-fold or clearly accessible.


Minimal fields (name, phone, email, short message).


QA Checklist:
Phone number visible without scrolling on desktop and mobile.


Sticky mobile CTA works and is obvious.


Contact form works and is easy to submit.



Step 9 â€“ GBP (Optional but Powerful)
Owner: You or advanced VA (case by case)
Decide which sites get GBP.


Start with one or a few high-potential winners.


Donâ€™t block the entire strategy on GBP verification.


Set up GBP correctly.


Match NAP exactly.


Use the closest-fitting primary category.


Add photos.


Encourage initial reviews.


Monitor leads.


Expect an increase in calls once GBP is live (potentially up to 5x).


QA Checklist:
GBP verified and live.


NAP matches site and citations.


At least a few photos uploaded; first reviews requested (where possible).



Step 10 â€“ Tracking & Analytics
Owner: You / Analytics Lead
Tracking essentials (must-have).


Unique phone number per site.


Tracking for form submissions (email or CRM).


Optional analytics.


Basic analytics for visitors and behavior.


Rank tracking for first cohort only (3â€“10 sites) to learn patterns.


Avoid over-complex analytics.


Donâ€™t spend more on fancy rank trackers than you spend on domains.


For mature portfolios, rely on lead flow as the primary KPI.


QA Checklist:
Call tracking numbers assigned and working.


Form submissions reach you reliably.


You can see basic visitor and lead stats per site.



Step 11 â€“ Portfolio Management: Crush / Meh / Fail
Owner: You / Portfolio Manager
Categorize sites after a reasonable period (e.g., 3â€“6 months):


Crush: consistent leads, strong rankings.


Meh: some leads, okay rankings, but not great.


Fail: very few leads, poor rankings; multiple issues.


Decisions:


For â€œCrushâ€:


Consider adding GBP.


Consider further content expansion or minor optimization.


For â€œMehâ€:


Fix quick wins (obvious issues) only if it takes little time.


For â€œFailâ€:


Unless thereâ€™s a trivial fix, build new sites instead of obsessively fixing.


Remember the rule of thumb:


Expect ~â…“ crush, â…“ meh, â…“ fail.


This is baked into the economics; donâ€™t try to make every site a winner.



Step 12 â€“ Scaling with VAs & Guardrails Against Perfectionism
Owner: You
Turn this SOP into VA tasks.


Convert each step into:


Task description.


Inputs.


Outputs.


QA checklist.


Create templates and prompt snippets for content.


Hiring & training VAs.


Hire 1â€“2 VAs and have them:


Shadow you for the first few sites.


Take over repeatable tasks (building, citations, on-page implementation).


Guardrails (hard rules):


Max build time/site (e.g., â‰¤ 5 hours of human time).


If fixing a broken site takes >2 hours, build 5 new sites instead.


Never endlessly redesign one siteâ€™s visuals; use the template.


Founder/operator role.


You focus on:


Niche/keyword strategy.


System improvements.


Deciding where to deploy GBP and extra investment.


Avoid getting sucked back into production.



Alternatives & Trade-offs (Within the SOP)


Few high-quality branded sites vs many generic microsites


Trade-off: slower learning and higher per-site risk vs fast experimentation and portfolio safety.


WordPress + plugins vs flat CMS


Trade-off: ecosystem flexibility vs speed and scale simplicity.


Heavy link building vs minimal authority strategy


Trade-off: greater long-term ranking power vs higher cost and complexity.


GBP-first vs website-first


Trade-off: potentially faster local visibility vs GBP verification friction.


The SOP assumes you choose the high-volume microsite + fast stack + minimal authority + portfolio model.

Action Plan (Short Version)


If youâ€™re adopting this SOP:
Week 1â€“2:


Finalize stack, build one â€œgold standardâ€ site using Steps 1â€“8.


Week 3â€“4:


Add citations, tracking, and (optionally) GBP to the best-performing site.


Document everything as tasks/checklists.


Month 2â€“3:


Launch a cohort of 5â€“10 sites via VAs.


Start portfolio categorization (â€œcrush/meh/failâ€) after a few months.


Ongoing:


Double down on niches/structures that produce â€œcrushâ€ outcomes.


Kill perfectionism and keep building.



Assumptions & Open Questions


Assumptions:
You want a canonical SOP you can share with team/students, not just a narrative summary.


Youâ€™re aligned with the portfolio-first strategy (many cheap bets > one perfect site).


Youâ€™re comfortable with EMD-style local sites and basic local SEO concepts.


You intend to use VAs or team members to execute this at scale.


Open Questions:
Do you want this SOP turned into:


A clickable checklist (Notion/Doc style), or


A VA training packet (with examples, screenshots, prompt templates)?


Do you plan to integrate this into an existing course/module (so we should format it as lesson slides), or keep it as an internal internal SOP?


Confidence: 93%
 Confidence rationale: Both input summaries came from the same underlying video; the merged SOP keeps all substantive points, normalized small numeric differences, and restructured them into a coherent, stepwise procedure without introducing new claims.
